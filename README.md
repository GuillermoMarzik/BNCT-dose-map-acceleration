Accompanying code for the paper 'Acceleration of BNCT Dose Map Calculations via Convolutional Neural Networks'

Download model predictions from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t1043PF6x1Ec4xG_fSBGEP_5key6W8E0/view?usp=sharing

Then, move the dowloaded file to the folder ./predictions/unet_tcia_104_106_lossMSEpond_modSkip_dosiscomp

After that you can test the model. Folders _figures_ and _tables_ contain scripts for reproduction of the figures and tables of the paper, respectively.
